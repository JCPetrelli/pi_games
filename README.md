# π Games

## Project Description
After memorizing by hearth the first 2000 digits of π (for fun and mental training) I wanted a simple CLI system to revise them from time to time.
I also like to play games with friends like "Tell me the 512th digit of π!" (It's 4 btw) and see how much time I needed to answer.
This project solves all these needs for me and for whoever want to use it. It is extremely easy to install and you can play it on any computer with Python.
Have fun with π Games and let me know how to improve it!
